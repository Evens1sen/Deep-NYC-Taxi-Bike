# Deep_NYC_Taxi_Bike

This is the repo for the ITSC 2022 paper "Forecasting Regional Multimodal Transportation Demand with Graph Neural Networks: An Open Dataset!"
, the deep learning research in NYC taxi and bike prediction.

## Dataset

The original data is from the public datasets of NYC taxi and bike. The datasets can be downloaded from the websites below.

**Bike:** [Citi Bike System Data | Citi Bike NYC](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

**Taxi:** [TLC Trip Record Data - TLC (nyc.gov)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)

And we have done some data pre-processing for the Bike and Taxi datasets.
